# The HiQP Control Framework
Copyright (C) 2016-2017 Marcus A. Johansson

HiQP is a whole-body control framework for computing inverse kinematics (and dynamics in future releases) involving multiple objectives which can be incompatible. It uses the inequality task function approach in [1] and is based on hierarchical least-squares optimization. Lower-ranked tasks are fulfilled as good as possible (in the least-square sense) in the null-space of higher-ranked tasks. More details are given in [2] - available at http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1056500/FULLTEXT01.pdf. 

## Acknowledgements
Robert Krug and Todor Stoyanov at the AASS Research Institute at Örebro University, Sweden, have been important contributors to this project. Thank you.

## Upcoming features/changes
- A Wiki/user guide will be created as a tutorial on how to use HiQP with ROS. In the meantime, we refer to the hiqp_demos package for examples of how to use HiQP: git@github.com:OrebroUniversity/hiqp_demos.git
- The list of available service calls will be revised and extended.
- A capsule primitive will be added to the set of geometric primitives.
- The framework will be extended to compute controls on a joint acceleration level in order to enable inverse dynamics control. 

## Installation note

HiQP relies on Gurobi to solve Quadratic Programs (QPs). For academic use, a free license can be obtained at http://www.gurobi.com/. Make sure to set the corresponding environment variables as described in http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_linux/software_installation_guid.html. 

## How to cite HiQP

A publication presenting HiQP is in preparation. In the meantime, please refer to [2].
